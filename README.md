## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10.15.x

```shell
node --version
```

## Guide

### Setup

- Clone this repo by running `git clone git@github.com:Botmock/botmock-watson-export.git`

- Run `npm install`

- Create a `.env` file with the following variables (and your values filled in):

```console
BOTMOCK_TOKEN=""
BOTMOCK_TEAM_ID=""
BOTMOCK_PROJECT_ID=""
BOTMOCK_BOARD_ID=""
```

- Run `npm start`

- Find generated JSON in `./out`

The generated `.json` file should look something like:

```json
{
  "name": "project",
  "intents": [],
  "entities": [],
  "language": "en",
  "metadata": {},
  "description": "",
  "dialog_nodes": [],
  "workspace_id": "",
  "counterexamples": [],
  "learning_opt_out": false,
  "status": "Non Existent"
}
```

### Importing into Watson

- Visit your [IBM dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com)

- If you have preexisting Services in your Resource summary, choose them

- Otherwise, **Create resource** and choose Watson Assistant under 'AI'

- Find your Assistant service; then **Launch tool**

- Choose the 'Skills' tab and **Create new**

- Choose **Import skill**, and choose the previously generated `.json` file
